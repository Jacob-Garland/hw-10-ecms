# Employee Management System

## Description

Here is a CLI application that handles employees, departments, and roles for companies. The application is run through Node.JS, made with Typescript, and uses Databases (specifically Postgres for my version, but feel free to fork the repository and add your own). Part of week 10 homework for the Sept2024 UCF Full Stack Bootcamp.
